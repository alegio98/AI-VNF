# AI-VNF

Internship project developed in collaboration with Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE)

During my Master’s degree in Computer Engineering, I conducted a research project focused on the application of Machine Learning techniques—particularly Random Forest and Gradient Boosting—for estimating computational resource allocation (CPU, RAM, disk, I/O) within virtualized network functions (VNFs) like NGINX, HAProxy, Squid, and Mosquitto.

Key points:
- Developed and benchmarked models using open datasets from the SoftNet Data Zoo
- Built regression models to predict resource usage using 300+ network and application-level metrics
- Evaluated performance using R², MAE, MSE, and RMSE across different VNFs
- Implemented in Python using Scikit-learn; analysis supported by real-world use cases in NFV/SDN

### Final goal: enabling dynamic scaling strategies to reduce cost and energy waste for enterprise systems
